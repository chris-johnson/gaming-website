## Why digital?

Modern game discs are essentially redemption codes.

## Reasons to sell your physical collection

With the amount of games you're interested in, you're only going to be able to play most of them once. You can still play them on original hardware. While not likely, they could get damaged, lost, stolen, or become non-functional. In any case, you're going to need to rely on digital backups anyway.

## Rental stores

You never *owned* the game. You were granted a license to play the game. (When you buy a toaster, do you own the toaster, or are you granted a license to use it?) Were mom and pop rental stores legally allowed to rent out their games?
