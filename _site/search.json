    "text": "i means interlaced p means progressive scan (not interlaced)\nA family of resolutions is denoted by some number of rows followed by i or p. 720p refers to the family of resolutions with 720 rows and some number of columns. The rows and columns define the aspect ratio. Some are very common.\nSpecific resolutions have trade names (wc?) like SD, HD, QHD, 4K, 8K, etc. These are harder to interpret. This can be thought of as spatial resolution.\nTVs and monitors also have a temporal resolution. The refresh rate is provided in Hertz (Hz), occurrences per second.\nThe number of pixels is the product of the rows and columns. Because this number is large, it is often expressed in megapixels, where mega is 10^6 or 1 million. For example, 2560 × 1440 = 3686400 pixels. Question: Pixels is obviously a square. meters × meters = meters^2. What is the unit for rows and columns? Are pixel dimensions standard? Obviously they can be blown up on screen, but on the physical monitor, are they standardized?\n3686400 pixels is ~3.69 × 10^6 pixels, or ~3.68 megapixels."

This is fixed with V-Sync.\nThis is why you have the option to decrease the resolution. Not only does the GPU need to render an image (which all can do), but it needs to do it quickly and repeatedly.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that even if your gaming PC is capable of generating 90 FPS in your favorite game at your preferred settings, and even if your monitor supports 90Hz, 120Hz or more, you could still be capped by the lower refresh rate capabilities of the ports on your graphics card and display. Read our blog post on DisplayPort vs HDMI vs DVI vs VGA to learn about the pros, cons and limitations of the different types of connections. For example, some gaming monitors feature 120Hz refresh rates, but have HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.4. This means that you can only take advantage of the 120Hz refresh rate if your use DisplayPort; you’ll be stuck at 60Hz if you use HDMI.\n\nhttps://www.avadirect.com/blog/displayport-vs-hdmi-vs-dvi-vs-vga/\nhttps://www.avadirect.com/blog/frame-rate-fps-vs-hz-refresh-rate/amp/\nMonitors: responsive.

The LED should be RED indicating update mode. Run the RetroTINK Firmware Update tool. The installer will have left a shortcut on your desktop. Hit ‘Search’. You should see ‘FT232R USB UART’ appear in the box. Hit ‘Load HEX’ and point to the .hex file you downloaded. Hit ‘Flash’. The update process should start. If the window freezes, that is okay - the update should complete after a minute or two. Just be patient. Your device should reboot and be ready to use.\nIf you accidentally interrupt the process, just start over from step 4."

    "text": "Selling price is a function of how many copies are available in the market. Example: EA Sports NCAA Football 14. Only a limited quantity were produced, and it can’t be released digitally. When the retrogaming community started to grow, this game’s selling price began to increase due to its rarity both in print and the market. Even with a limited copy produced, if all the copies were always for sale, then the price wouldn’t rise. When there are more buyers than sellers, the price increases. How much depends on how many buyers.\nThe other reason prices climb is due to fees associated with the purchase. Postage is an added cost, seller fees are another, and tax is a third. Sellers typically want to break even and recoup all the money they spent or make a profit. To do so, they have to include the added costs to the sale price. Since everyone has this mentality, the prices will continue to climb. At some point, someone has to take a loss.\nYou only take a loss if you plan to sell. If you plan to keep, you have to weigh the purchase price against the value. Value is up to the individual. You need to decide what delta between price paid and value would cause you to sell. If the value decreases (played the game, but it’s not replayable, or it wasn’t your cup of tea), then you can start comparing market value vs. price paid.\nWhy time is important:\nNeed to consider the fact that turnover means the price has increased due to the added fees.\nRetrogaming on PlayStation: https://www.playstation.com/en-us/editorial/this-month-on-playstation/introducing-classic-arcade-games-you-can-play-on-ps5-and-ps4/\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_remasters_for_PlayStation_consoles"

    "text": "The PS1 can be soft-modded by creating a UNIROM memory card. Below are instructions on how to install UNIROM onto a standard PS1 memory card.\nNote: If your console model is SCPH-1001 or SCPH-9002, two memory cards are required.\nGather\n\nPS2\nMemory card with FMCB or FHDB installed\nFAT32-formatted USB drive\n\nCreating a UNIROM card is accomplished with a PS2, a program called Memory Card (MC) Annihilator, and FreePSXBoot (the exploit for the PS1). A memory card with FreePSXBoot installed is known as a UNIROM card.\nMC Annihilator is an elf program that can be launched with LaunchELF. It is used to format the PS1 card (if not already formatted) and “restore” the FreePSXBoot image.\n\n\n\n\nThe software is provided at https://www.github.com/brad-lin/FreePSXBoot/releases\nGet the model number from the PS1 (e.g. SCPH-101). Find that model in the table, then copy the associated installer filename (extension mcd).\nScroll down, and find the hyperlink to the installer.\n\n\n\nGo to PSX-Place and download MC Annihilator (software) by ffgriever.\nhttps://www.psx-place.com/resources/memory-card-annihilator-coded-by-ffgriever-gfx-by-berion.673/\nExtract “MC Annihilator v2.0.zip”. Copy the extracted folder and the FreePSXBoot software (mcd file) to the root of the USB drive.\n\n\n\n\nInsert the USB drive into one of the PS2’s USB ports. Insert the FMCB card into the left slot and the PS1 card into the right slot. Boot up the PS2. Launch LaunchELF (or uLaunchELF).\nFind mass0:/. Open the folder for MC Annihilator. Run mca_v20.elf. Select Slot 2.\nNote: If the PS1 card has not been formatted, MC Annihilator has a format utility. Regardless of if you format it with the PS1 or PS2 ahead of time, or format it with MC Annihilator’s formatting tool, just make sure to do it. Tl;dr: Format the PS1 memory card.\nRun “Restore MC image”. Find mass0:/ and drill into it. Press R2 to reveal the mcd file. (R2 disables the file mask.) Select the mcd file. This writes the image to the PS1 card. Power off the PS2, and remove the PS1 card and USB drive.\n\n\n\nPlug the PS1 card into the left slot on the PS1. Turn on the PS1. UNIROM will load and a home screen will appear. The UNIROM card can be removed.\nThe Boot CD allows backup discs to be played. It can also run original discs from other regions or backups of those."
