## Dumping PS2 BIOS files

All PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulators require official PS2 BIOS files. There are now two legal ways to obtain these:

* dump them from original hardware that you own, or 
* extract them from PlayStation 3 (PS3) firmware.

Note: The tools needed to dump the PS2 BIOS files from original hardware will be specific to the PS2 model youâ€™re using. The 30000 to 70000 series use FreeMCBoot. Some of the 90000 series consoles can use FreeMCBoot as well, while others require Fortuna or other solutions.
